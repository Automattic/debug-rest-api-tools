# Debug REST Api Tools

A WordPress plugin to assist with debugging REST API requests.

## Usage

1. Install and activate this on the WordPress site you wish to debug
2. Either define the `WP_DEBUG` constant as true via your `wp-config.php` file or include a `WP_DEBUG=true` query parameter in your REST endpoint request.


### What this does

This tool hooks into the WordPress REST Api and exposes data from generation of
the response to a REST request.  Currently the following data is exposed:

| Header | Description |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `X-A8C-last-query` | The value of `$wpdb->last_query`. So whatever the last query was executed by `$wpdb` |
| `X-A8C-all-queries` | The value of `$wpdb->queries` filtered to only include queries generated by REST controllers.
